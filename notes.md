=========================

Create Repository in GitHub
---------------------------
Go to GitHub and create a repository, giving the following information:

* Repository name: my-map
* Description: Map of coffee shops I goto
* Select "Public - Anyone can see this repository. You choose who can commit."
* Select: "Initialize this repository with a README"
* Add .gitignore: Jekyll, this is closest to what we want
* Add a license: MIT License


Clone a copy of the repository on your laptop
---------------------------------------------

At the end of this

* Go to where you will want to put your Coffee Map project.  For myself I have a directory called "Projects" that I keep all of my projects.
* In your Projects directory clone your repositiory.  I used the command line

    git clone git@github.com:zmon/my-map-doc.git

You should endup with a directory called *my-map*
